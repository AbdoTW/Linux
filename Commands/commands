when you write ls -al , you see this line for each folder or file   drwx------ 44 abdelrahman-tawfik abdelrahman-tawfik  4096 Jun 23 19:20 .config 
you can change the user and group owner called abdelrahman-tawfik. drwx-------  d means directory not file and rwx means read write executable for owner 
"drwx --- ---"    without d there are 9 bits each 3 bit for "owner group other" for each one can give access for write read execute 
we can change all of this , we can change the user and group owner or one of them using """sudo chown newuser:groupname filename""" chown means change owner 
and we can set permissions for this file or folder using ""sudo chmod --- filename"" each - is a octan number and means give access for "owner group other" in order 
if first - equal 5 that's mean in 3 bit 101 and means yes for read , no for write , yes for execute for the owner , and the second char - if equal 7 means 111 in binary 
and this mean every one with me in the groups can write read execute , and third char - if eqal 1 means 001 no for read , no for write , yes for execute for any one

problems

how can i remove wifi hotspot app 

what is the snap and linux-wifi-hotspot in the home directory ?? and what is the thunderbird.tmp folder in the downloads ??

what is the difference between 
cd home/abdo --> in the same directory   ,  ----------> 1 
/home/abdo  --> the path from the root (entire path ) ,
and ./home/abdo -->   . from root to the current directory   -------------> 2  && . means the current directory

ps ---> show all the process &&   fg + tab ---> forground >> return the stopped processes to running 
bg ---> background --> running the current program in the background 
jobs --> show all the waiting processes and the running background programs (stopped or running in the background )
